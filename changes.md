# Portfolio Changes
# Hero Section Changes

## Layout
- Center all hero content vertically and horizontally within the viewport.
- Use a flexbox or grid layout to ensure everything stays centered on all screen sizes.
- Add enough spacing between the heading, subheading, and buttons.

## Content
- Main heading: Big, bold, modern typography for introduction text.
- Subheading: Smaller text underneath that briefly describes skills and style.
- Buttons:
  - Button 1: "Download Resume" — solid primary style.
  - Button 2: Existing call-to-action button (e.g., "View Work") — outlined style.
- Buttons should sit side-by-side with consistent spacing, stacking on smaller screens.

## Styling
  - Large headline font size and weight.
  - Center-aligned text.
  - Responsive design so it looks balanced on desktop and mobile.
- Ensure the hero background stays consistent with current theme/background.
- Use theme colors for buttons and typography.

## Extras
- Make sure the “Download Resume” button downloads a PDF file (resume.pdf in public folder).
- Keep accessibility in mind — proper contrast, aria-labels if needed.
